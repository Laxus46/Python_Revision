# Operators in Python

Python supports various types of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise, identity, and membership operators12.
## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.
| Operator | Example | Meaning | Result |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| + | a + b | Addition | Sum of a and b |
| - | a - b | Subtraction | Difference of a and b |
| * | a * b | Multiplication | Product of a and b |
| / | a / b | Division | Quotient of a and b |
| % | a % b | Modulus | Remainder of a divided by b |
| // | a // b | Floor Division | Quotient of a and b, rounded down to the nearest integer |
| ** | a ** b | Exponentiation | a raised to the power of b |


## Comparison Operators
| Operator | Example | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| == | a == b | Equal to |
| != | a != b | Not equal to |
| < | a < b | Less than |
| > | a > b | Greater than |
| <= | a <= b | Less than or equal to |
| >= | a >= b | Greater than or equal to |

## Logical Operators
| Operator | Example | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| and | a and b | True if both a and b are True |
| or | a or b | True if either a or b is True |
| not | not a | True if a is False |

## Bitwise Operators
| Operator | Example | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| & | a & b | Bitwise AND |
| \| | a \| b | Bitwise OR |
| ^ | a ^ b | Bitwise XOR |
| ~ | ~a | Bitwise NOT |
| << | a << b | Bitwise left shift |
| >> | a >> b | Bitwise right shift |

## Identity Operators
| Operator | Example | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| is | a is b | True if a and b are the same object |
| is not | a is not b | True if a and b are not the same object |

## Membership Operators

| Operator | Example | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| in | a in b | True if a is a member of b |
| not in | a not in b | True if a is not a member of b |
