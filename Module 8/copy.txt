How Does the Python Interpreter Work?
The Python interpreter is called “CPython” and it's written in the C programming language. This is the default implementation for Python.

In the following sections, you will understand how the Python interpreter works behind the scenes.

Source Code Analysis
Actually, any translator starts with the source code analysis. Here the Python interpreter receives the source code and initializes some instructions to do the following things:

It follows the indentation rule and checks the Python syntax. Maybe there are some incorrect lines, so it will stop the program from the execution to show the error message.

This phase is called lexical analysis, which means dividing the source code files into a list of tokens

In the following step, the interpreter will generate byte codes. Let's see how that works.

Byte Code Generation
Once the parser of the Python interpreter receives the tokens, it starts to manipulate the lexical tokens. It generates a big structure called the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).

The interpreter converts this AST to byte code which means machine language. In Python, the byte code can be saved in a file ending with the “.pyc” extension.

In the following section, you will see how the python interpreter executes these byte codes.

The Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
The Python interpreter initializes its runtime engine called PVM which is the Python virtual machine.

The interpreter loads the machine language with the library modules and inputs it into the PVM. This converts the byte code into executable code such as 0s and 1s (binary).

And then it prints the results.

Note that if an error happens during the PVM process, the executor will terminate the operation immediately to display the error.

Now you will learn how to install Python on your operating system.

If you have no Python software or you're using a mobile device, you can use any online Python compiler.
